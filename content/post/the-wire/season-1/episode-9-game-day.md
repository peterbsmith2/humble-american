# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "Game Day"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**Proposition Joe**  
This some of Avon's shit.  
You got Avon Barksdale chasing  
your ass all around town...  
and you still find time to take his shit.  
  
**Omar**  
It's your shit now.  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
What I want with that?  
  
**Omar**  
What anybody want with that, man?  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
How much you asking?  
  
**Omar**  
Oh, we free.  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
Free?  
  
**Omar**  
I'm saying, I got a little proposition for you.  
Proposition is,  
you get four G-packs for free...  
you give me some better idea  
on how I can reach Avon.  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
How to contact him?  
  
**Omar**  
You all just had a game, right?  
How you get a hold of him to parley?  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
We talk now and then.  
I page his ass.  
  
**Omar**  
Okay.  
Okay.  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
That all you need?  
A number?  
  
**Omar**  
I make do with it.  
And a code for one of his peoples.  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
What Wee-Bey use, 07?  
  
**Omar**  
07.  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
What makes you think  
I ain't gonna take this off your hands...  
and throw your ass up outta here?  
  
**Omar**  
Come on, man, Avon goes down,  
the projects be open market again, right?  
  
**Proposition Joe**  
Let me understand.  
Avon loses $100,000 to me on a bet...  
then you bring me some of his shit...  
so that I can put  
your predatory self on his ass.  
Not his day, is it?  

### Analysis
Omar makes use of the [advantageous]().
