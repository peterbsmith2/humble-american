# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Buys"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**McNulty**  
Hey, Pat.  
We got a job for you guys  
to try to run down.  
  
**Mahone**  
...huh  
  
**Polk**  
What is it?  
  
**McNulty**  
We need a photo of this guy, Barksdale.  
We need to know what he looks like.  
  
**Mahone**  
So go down to the B of I.  
  
**McNulty**  
You see, that's the problem, guys.  
Barksdale's never been arrested  
as an adult...  
so we don't really have a B of I photo.  
He had his juvenile record expunged,  
so there's no photo there either.  
  
**Mahone**  
Then you're fucked.  
  
**McNulty**  
Yeah, we are.  
  
**McNulty**  
But seeing as we all came into work today,  
I thought, let's try something different.  
  
**McNulty**  
So we know from his mother's  
social service record...  
that Barksdale grew up  
in Franklin Terrace, right?  
It occurred to me...  
being vaguely familiar  
with the high-rises of West Baltimore...  
that the housing project  
began to take photos...  
of every registered resident  
as a security measure.  
  
  
**McNulty**  
Am I correct, Detective Greggs?  
  
**Greggs**  
Yeah.  
  
**Mahone**  
So you want us to go down  
to the housing department...  
and pull his photo.  
  
**McNulty**  
Excellent.  
You know, you and l, we think as one.  
We're like two horses together in a harness.  
  
**Mahone**  
Why don't you fucking do it yourself?  
  
**McNulty**  
Sure, if you don't mind sitting in my desk,  
reviewing homicide folders...  
taking meticulous notes,  
trying to run down a few new leads.  
It's boring, painstaking work,  
but if you don't want...  
to travel to the housing department,  
I'll switch with you.  
  
**Polk**  
Fuck it, Patrick. Let's take a ride.  
  
**Greggs**  
That was inspiring.  
  
**McNulty**  
I'm a leader of men.  
  
### Analysis
In this scene McNulty first [concedes]() to Mahone's objection "Then you're fucked." Then goes on to state the facts. From this mahone reaches the conclusion himself.  Skip ahead, another objection from Mahone "Then why don't you fucking do it yourself?" McNulty responds by using [concession](), [enargeia](), and describing the alternative to his choice in painful ways. Polks agrees, agreeing for Mahone as well.
