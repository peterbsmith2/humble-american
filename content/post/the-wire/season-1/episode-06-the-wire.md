# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Wire"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire  
### Scene  
**Greggs**  
You could go to Foerster,  
or the Deputy Ops.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Why come crying to me?  
Why not go to your friend, the judge?  
  
**McNulty**  
I don't see a circuit court judge  
being able to argue...  
the city homicide commander  
out of three murders...  
even if the cases are all weak sisters.  
It's put-up or shut-up time, Lieutenant.  
Either you step up or you send us all home.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
So this is on me?  
  
**McNulty**  
I don't see anyone else  
in charge of this detail.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Rawls is a major.  
  
**McNulty**  
Rawls is an asshole.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
My point is, he ranks me on this.  
  
**McNulty**  
_gives a look to Greggs_   
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Chain of command might mean  
nothing to you, McNulty.  
  
**McNulty**  
What'd I tell you?  
  
### Analysis  
McNulty does a good [either or]().
