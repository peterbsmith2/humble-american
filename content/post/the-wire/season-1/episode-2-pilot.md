# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Detail"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
So, give me Sydnor.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
No way.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
He's my best man, you can't take him.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I'm taking your worst, remember?  

**Lt. Contrell**  
How about Steinman?  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore,  
I need a black guy for surveillance.  
I need Sydnor.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Jesus, know what Prez did this morning?  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
Tell me.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
He put a bullet through a wall,  
dry-firing in the detail office.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
Look, no promises.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
You give me Sydnor,  
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.  

### Analysis
In this vignette Lt Daniels is persistent in his argument that Contrell give him Sydnor. He asks four times in as many sentences. As written, Daniels is persistent without commiting any [rhetorical fouls]() nor resorting to [argument by stick](). In the show the tone of the actor is exasperated. However, in plain written letter above you can read that Lt. Daniels was 100% effective in his persuasiveness.

### Scene
**Herc**  
This case isn't shit, Carv.  
  
**Carver**  
I know it.  
  
**Herc**  
We're dancing around  
with this motherfucker, typing shit out...  
taking pictures of assholes in hats.  
What the fuck is that?  
  
**Carver**  
It's bullshit.  
  
**Herc**  
I say we go down there right now.  
Right fucking now.  
We go into those towers,  
and we let them know.  
  
**Prez**  
[chuckles]  
  
**Herc**  
I'm serious.  
  
You got to let these motherfuckers know  
who you are.  
  
**Herc**  
You coming?  
  
**Prez**  
I'm with you.  
  
**Herc**  
Carv?  
  
**Carver**  
What the hell?  
  
**Herc**  
Let's do it.  
Come on.  
  
**[The Towers]**  
Shut it down. Five-O.  
Five-O, five-O, break out.  
  
**Carver**  
Yo, come here, man.  
Come here, where you going?  
Don't act like you don't know me.  
Get your hands up.  
  
**Herc**  
Put that down.  
  
**Prez**  
Drop that shit! Kiss the fucking ground!  
  
**Carver**  
Put your hands up.  
Don't look at me like I ain't talking English.  
  
**Herc**  
You got a needle on you?  
  
**Carver**  
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?  
No? What's that?  
What you got in your pockets?  
You know what?  
Put your pants down, man.  
Put your pants down  
and get down on the ground.  
Get down on the fucking ground!  
All right, spread your shit out.  
Nice shoes. Think a happy thought.  
  
**[The Towers]**  
Why don't you go somewhere else  
with that bullshit?  
No-good motherfuckers.  
  
**Carver**  
Stay down, man, stay down.  
  
**Herc**  
Y'all can let Barksdale and them know  
who owns these towers.  
  
**Carver**  
'Cause we're coming back.  
  
**Herc**  
I'm sick of this shit.  
  
**[The Towers]**  
Kiss my ass!  
  
**Carver**  
We roll out, come back in an hour,  
catch everybody dirty.  
You'll see how that goes.  
  
**[Tower Resident]**  
That's bullshit, man.  
  
**Carver**  
Yo, stay down, man.  
  
**[Tower Resident]**  
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.  
  
**Carver**  
Want something?  
  
**Prez**  
Move, shitbird.  
  
**Kid**  
I ain't doing nothing.  
  
**Prez**  
Really? I got nothing for you.  
  
**Kid**  
My eye, my eye.  
  
**Prez**  
Who you gonna eyefuck now?  
Are you serious?  
You bleed on my car?  
Don't bleed on my car.  
Get your shit off my car.  
  
**Carver**  
What the fuck's the matter with you?  
  
**Carver**  
Got a visual?  
  
**Herc**  
Fuck.  
  
**Herc**  
Get the radio.  
  
**Carver**  
11 :35, Signal 13.  
771 Franklin, in the Court.  
  
**Herc**  
Son of a bitch!  
  
**Carver**  
Shots fired, shots fired.  
Officers need assistance.  
  
**Herc**  
I'm hit!  
  
**Carver**  
Signal 13.  
Officer down, Officer down!  
  
**Herc**  
Shit!  
  
### Analysis
The rhetoric of this scene is subtle. As you read it, it doesn't have any fantastic devices. It's a few cops, Herc, Carver, and Prez shouting commands. There's no reply to the commands. When watching the scene it doesn't stand out, you're watching the picture. Yet, they're shouting commands at tenants of a high rise housing project complex. At the end of the scene those tenants start throwing stuff at the cops and one fires a gun. They're not arguing. The cops don't argue. It's all [argument by stick](), a rhetorical foul.

### Scene  
**Carver**    
They jumped us, Boss.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Who?  
  
**Carver**  
Fucking project niggers.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
What are you doing here  
at 2:00 in the morning?  
  
**Carver**  
Field interviews, sir, police work.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Police work?  
  
**Herc**  
Yeah.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I got a 14-year-old in critical  
but stable condition at University...  
and two witnesses who say  
one of you princes...  
cold-cocked him  
with the butt-end of a pistol.  
  
**Herc**  
No, sir.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I got his mother over at IID...  
filing a formal brutality charge...  
which for Herc will make an even four  
in the last two years.  
  
**Herc**  
None sustained.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
But all of them true.  
  
**Carver**  
Lieutenant We thought that--  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I got one less Crown Vic  
than I had last night.  
I'm out two Kevlar vests  
that burned in the car...  
two hand-held radios, a shotgun...  
and I'm about to lose this idiot here  
for a week or two of medical.  
And for what?  
  
**Carver**  
Lieutenant We thought that--  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
What did you all learn  
when you went to the Terrace...  
at 2:00 in the morning  
to conduct field interviews?  
What valuable information did  
we acquire from this situation?  
IID is gonna be on all three of you  
by afternoon...  
and if you don't get a story straight  
by then...  
you're gonna have a file thick enough  
to see the light of a trial board.  
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?  
  
**Prez**  
Me.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Why?  
  
**Prez**  
He pissed me off.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,  
he did not piss you off.  
He made you fear for your safety  
and that of your fellow officers.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I'm guessing now, but maybe...  
he was seen to pick up a bottle  
and menace officers Hauk and Carver...  
both of whom had already sustained injury  
from flying projectiles.  
Rather than use deadly force  
in such a situation...  
maybe you elected to approach the youth,  
ordering him to drop the bottle.  
Maybe when he raised the bottle  
in a threatening manner...  
you used a Kel-Light,  
not the handle of your service weapon...  
to incapacitate the suspect.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Go practice.  
You fuck the bullshit up  
when you talk to internal...  
I can't fix it, you're on your own.  
  
### Analysis
Lt. Daniels has great rhetorical use of [division]() when suggesting a better story (bullshit) of what happened when Prez hit the kid with the butt of his gun.  Before that he does a lot of [narration](). Then he ends it with a [proof](), "go practice. You fuck the bullshit up when you talk to internal...I can't fix it, you're on your own." Perhaps, as is the case with non-dramatic real-life, there is no need for a formal conclusion, the scene simply ends.
