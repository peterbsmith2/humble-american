# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Pager"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**Stringer**  
It's been a little hectic down here,  
right, cuz?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
String, man, I can't lie.  
Them stick-up boys,  
they caught us dead up.  
And the narcos, shit,  
I don't know what the fuck that was.  
  
  
**[Low-Rise]**  
5-0. Comin' up!  
5-0 comin' up, y'all.  
Time-out.  
  
**Stringer**  
C'mon, man, what is that?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
What?  
  
**Stringer**  
You gotta get your crew  
to understand that...  
it's the stick-up crews and the creepers...  
that give us the most trouble.  
When they start thinking like that...  
you're not gonna have any more surprises,  
you feel me?  
'Cause you know, your uncle and me...  
we think you got a snitch up in the shop.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
What?  
  
**Stringer**  
Someone who tips off the stick-up crew.  
And you gotta be on that, right?  
You gotta be on that.  
I'm gonna tell you what you do.  
What day is it today, Friday?  
What happen on Friday?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Payday.  
  
**Stringer**  
Not this Friday.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Why not?  
  
**Stringer**  
No, what you gonna do  
is you gonna call 'em...  
like you gonna pay 'em  
and then you crack 'em.  
You tell 'em you're not happy...  
with what they fuckin' pass  
as work down here.  
And when you're not happy,  
they ain't gettin' paid. You feel me?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yeah, but String, you don't pay a nigger,  
he ain't gonna work for you.  
  
**Stringer**  
What, you think a nigger's gonna get a job?  
You think these niggers  
gonna be like, "Fuck it...  
"let me quit this game here  
and go to college"?  
Naw, they gonna buck a little,  
but they not gonna walk.  
And in the end, you gonna get respect.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yeah.  
  
**Stringer**  
And when that money run out,  
they'll come up to you and roll on you...  
and ask you for an advance and shit,  
when they flat-ass broke.  
Them the niggers  
that you strike off your list.  
But that nigger that stay eatin'...  
the nigger that steady rollin',  
ain't askin' you for shit...  
that's the nigger I want  
to hear about. Understand?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yeah, man, shit, you know how  
to play a nigger into a corner, String.  
  
### Analysis  
D'Angelo misses an opportunity to [concede]() and redefine, a combination that makes for [rhetoric ju jitsu]().
