# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Hunt"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**Maurice Levy**  
If he calls me for anything,  
I'll tell him to turn himself in.  
I'm going to do that.  
  
**McNulty**  
Not good enough.  
  
**Maurice Levy**  
Excuse me?  
  
**McNulty**  
We need him now.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
No, thanks.  
Perhaps as an officer of the court...  
  
**McNulty**  
Ronnie here is being polite.  
She's a member of your twisted little tribe.  
She's putting it into  
your twisted little language. Me?  
I wouldn't wipe my ass  
with a Baltimore lawyer.  
  
**McNulty**  
No offense.  
  
**Maurice Levy**  
None taken.  
  
**McNulty**  
I mean, I'm willing  
to let you little ratfuckers suborn perjury...  
blow smoke up a judge's ass  
and jury-tamper your balls off...  
without losing the slightest bit  
of my sunny disposition.  
Fuck me if I don't let you structure  
your cash into briefcase fees, either.  
That's between you and the IRS.  
Neither one of you is anyone's friend, right?  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
What Jimmy is trying to say is--  
  
**McNulty**  
No, what Jimmy is saying is if you want  
my nose closed to your shit...  
you have to throw me something  
when I need it.  
And right now I need Savino Bratton  
in bracelets.  
  
**Maurice Levy**  
I don't know where he is.  
  
**McNulty**  
You repped him the last four felonies.  
I guess you can get word to him  
if you want to.  
A police may die, Morrie,  
and Savino was there.  
He comes in this afternoon...  
and he takes the drug charge at least.  
  
**Maurice Levy**  
Or what?  
  
**McNulty**  
Or we send tactical teams  
into his momma's house every night...  
until there's no house left to worry about.  
You get a target letter  
from the state's attorney's office...  
followed by subpoenas  
for every bank account...  
in your fucking name.  
And let's see if all those cash deposits  
match the reported income.  
  
**Maurice Levy**  
I'm hearing this from him...  
and I understand that he's distraught.  
I understand that.  
Am I hearing this from  
the state's attorney's office as well?  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
You are.  
  
**Maurice Levy**  
I'll see what I can do.  
  
[Outside Levy's Office]  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
Fuck you, Jimmy!  
You didn't tell me that was coming.  
  
**McNulty**  
He'll bring him in.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
He will if he can, that's not the point.  
  
**McNulty**  
What's the point?  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
The point is that Morrie Levy is a past  
officer of the Monumental Bar Association...  
and unless I want  
to spend my whole life as a fucking ASA...  
I can't spend my afternoons  
pissing on people who matter.  
  
**McNulty**  
Another career in the balance.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
Fuck you.  
  
**McNulty**  
No, fuck you.  
If only half of you  
in the state's attorney's office...  
didn't want to be judges...  
didn't want to be partners  
in a downtown law firm...  
if you had the balls to follow through,  
you know what would happen?  
A guy like that would be indicted,  
tried and convicted.  
The rest of them would back up...  
so we could push a clean case  
But no, everybody stays friends.  
Everybody gets paid.  
And everybody's got a fucking future.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
You'll just use anyone, won't you?  
  
### Analysis
Jimmy uses the [advantageous]() by explaining to Levy why it's to his disadvantage to protect Savino. Rhonda pointing out that Jimmy may have gotten his way at the cost of Pearlman's relationship.
