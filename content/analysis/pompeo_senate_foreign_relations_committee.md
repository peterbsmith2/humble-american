## Analysis Date: 08/07/2018

### Key Speakers
- Mr. Corker, Chairman
- Mr. Menendez, Ranking Member
- Honorable Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State
- Mr Risch

### Notes
- pompeo seems unprepared due to uneven timing
- in response to the very first question, pompeo immediately uses a stance of relevance. then he follows up to assert, after stating a number of points i would have thought, based on his position, would have
  - gone unstated, 'i think i have a pretty good understand of what happened at that meeting'
- a lot of dodged questions
