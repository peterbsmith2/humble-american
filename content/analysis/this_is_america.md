### Assertions
Donald Glover made a music video called "This is America." After an election in 2016 that went the wrong way from an institutional perspective, if not democratic perspective, all claims to defining America are provocative.

As an audio piece, the song is basic in the way that all hits are basic. Repitition and simple words make up the bulk of the song. Complex lyricism is featured in many of Glover's previous works. For example, in Sweatpants he uses the line "I've got penthouses on both coasts, pH balance." And in Heartbeat, "I got a heart, but the artichoke is the only thing girls when you in that smoke."

As a video, the dance moves are in line with his previous work and with modern music videos. For example, in Sober he dances with a similar free-form style. The style in "This is America" is a bit like Bruno Mars' "That's What I Like," and also at times a bit like the intermission of the Kendrick Lamar video of These Walls with Terry Crews. The video is not only Glover dancing. His actions, like shooting people, and the actions of people in the background, narrative-free and regularly changing, make the video visually dense.


It appears that the audience watching the video is not interested in only the audio and the video of the piece. The audience is looking to apply meaning to it.

Great art sparks discussion. So this video has achieved that status. There is small political value to this piece of art, it is not sparking a deliberation about how to solve problems in our society. The video is not logical. It is character-driven as well as emotional. Character-driven refers to the way the audience looks at Glover. Glover is the son of an artist whose work has been featured in the  Museum of Modern Art in New York. More than that, he is an artist who commutes from television to music to comedy to movies in the same way as a commuter travels from work to the grocery shop to home. By featuring himself in the video, he guarantees that the viewer will be thinking about him. Can you hear his percentage take of box office ticket sales climbing too?  Additionally, the video is mostly being watched by individuals. As a delivery mechanism, the Internet is the most isolated medium for visual media. There is one viewer watching the video from the phone, not three watching from the couch. Does any average audience member have as much character status as Donald Glover? No. What if this video were watched by three people at the same time, not by one at a time. Would it be as talked about? The gun violence, the music, and more, all make the video emotional. It is sparks a feeling before a thought.

The piece makes no conclusions. It cannot inspire any social action - though it can spark social media.
