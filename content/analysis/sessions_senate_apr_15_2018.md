## Analysis Date: 06/15/2018

### Key Speakers
Ranking member Shaheen
Attorney General Sessions

### Notes
- "omnibus" code word
- AG has a long introduction by comparison to the chair and the ranking member
- senator leahy asked a question, then the AG responded with an insistence on following the rules
  - i consider that inflexible insistence on the rules
- a senator speaking on medical marijuana asked questions of the AG who responded with 'i would say...' and made many references to 'science' as a basis for judgement - with that generic statement he appealed to a higher authority
- [from the senator before the senator from Alaska, McKowski] when speaking on pardons the AG made a difference between the pardons of clinton and the pardons of Trump
  - the pardons of clinton were 'shocking' and the pardons of the trump people were...
    - one of the guys was 87 and convicted of a misdemeaonr
    - one of the other guys contributed a lot to america
- in response to a senator the AG says "i don't believe that's significant" then he moves up from a stance of quantity, to a stance of definition
