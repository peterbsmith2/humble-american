## People Involved
- Mr. Stretch - facebook

## Senators
- Mr. Whitehouse
- Mr. Graham
- Mr. Cruz
- Mr. Franken
- Ms. Klobuchar

## Notes
- Fb general attorney, incredible ethos raising apology
- twitter didnt sound as good, nor did google sound as good as fb. fb voice itself was strong and bullish.
- without seeing his face i assumed the general council for fb was younger than he is
- mr. whitehouse: "i gather that you companies have gone beyond the idea that your companies provide a platform and anything beyond that, which comes across that platform is not your affair?"
  - fb: "senator our commitment to addressing this problem is unwavering. we take this very seriously and are comitted to investing as necesary to prevent this from happening again."
    - he talks about his commitments.
- fb, responding to a question, and as a general theme in the first 1 hour 7 minutes and 51 seconds of this hearing, is talking a lot about values. What is values-based rhetoric?
- one senator wanted to pin the pelt of fb council to the wall, not accepting his talk about commitments
- fb, twitter, google, all purport that their ads can be self regulated, i.e. not subject to oversight
- Mr. Cruz narrates about the liberal bias of google, facebook, and twitter. Then asks, "so do you believe your platform is a neutral public forum."
  "how do you respond to accusations you're putting your thumb on the political scale?"
  - fb: "we train our people to protect against biases"
  - tw: ~our goal and one of the fundamental principles of the company is fairness..~ [not sure i got that right]
- A senator brings up the example of Donald Trump Jr. re-tweeting a proven fake article put out by the Russian Internet Research Institute, even the President
- A Senator shows an image of Aziz Ansari holding a "vote online" poster. The lawyer from twitter admitted it was voter suppression.
- A senator asks "Do you know who helped the Internet Research Agency in doing this targeting?"
  - fb: "we're not able to see behind the accounts, all we are able to see is the activity that is on our platform"
  "so it could have been a political campaign that provided this  information about targeting"
  - fb: "As I said, All we can see is the activity on our platform. All we esentially get is the targeting information, which we've provided to the committee."
  - ^ he doesn't say "yes its possible." He is arguing on fact. And re-asserting the fact.
- Franken "how could you not connect that american political ads paid for in russian rubles were coming from russia?"
  - Franken is entertaining, yet not persuasive - he's too simple 
  - fb: "we should have had a broader lens"
  - Franken: "you have all the knowledge of the world"
  - fb: "Senator we should have been alert to this. In hindsight its one we missed."
  - Franken (exasperated): "will you pledge not to accept politcal ads with yuan."
- fb has 150 people. twitter: "large team, 100s of people. we're at a different scale than fb and google, obviously" Google has "1000s of pepole working on these issues"
- mr. whitehouse makes an argument of relevance, citing a VICE news report where an advertiser spent very little money to get tremendous reach on facebook. "does that mean it is not particularly relevant that a small dollar amount was spent on political ads with respect to the potential damage it can have"
  - fb: "we're trying to find facts. we leave it to your investigation to learn more."
