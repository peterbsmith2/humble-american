## People Involved
Alana Semeuls  
Syracuse

### Notes
- introduction:
  - "thanks for coming"
  - "this is a fantastic crowd"
  - "thanks Clinton school, Nicoli Depippa"
- narration
  - "so uh i used to live in Pittsburgh"  
    - shares her story about Pittsburgh  
  - "perhaps thats why policy makers thought of cities as bodies...with sicknesses..."  
  - "1940 40% of people had cars...today 95%"  
She sounds like she's reading. And she is. It makes it sounds like she doesn't know what she's talking about as much. It's forced.  
- spoke to Manny Breeland in Syracuse
- 15th ward is the black neighborhood of Syracuse
  - btwn Syracuse University and Syracuse Downtown
  - poor but people were in the streets, playing. 
  - Junie Dunham (another Syracusan)
- other cities have put an interstate through its center
- she says multiple times that the highway was literally a road that made it easier for people to leave
- 1940 -> 2000 : 205,000 -> 147,000 (Syracuse, city). But Onondaga county had a growing population.  
- Joanie Mahoney "county will not subsidize any more sewer construction"
- city has minimum lot sizes, as well as restrictions on multi-family housing
- 2/3 of black poor live in "high poverty neighborhoods."
  - Carrier has left for overseas.
  - wages stagnant, harder to make ends meet than it used to be
- Ironically, the city has more concentrated poverty now than the 15Th ward did ages ago.
  
Proof (starts around 11 minutes)  
- Chicago starts moving the poor to condos in better neighborhoods. So does Baltimore  
- young professionals and baby boomers want to live somewhere walkable, near bars, offices, etc...
  - we have an urban renaissance 
- urban blvd is a proposal in place of I-81
- "coming together rather than tearing apart"
  - falls flat 
- derek thomson
Conclusion (15 minutes)  
- "sometimes these barriers are highways."
- "build a new one [highway] or expanding an existing one seems like a surefire way to make a city sick"

Q&A
- she asks "anyone else?" making the same mistake I did
