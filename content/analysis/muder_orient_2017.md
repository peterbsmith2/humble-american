### Key Speakers  
  
### Notes  
The music is super fast  
The visuals are stark   
The lighting is soft with shadows on half his face  
The narration of the case   
Then the division  
Then he does a shock, that’s in his proof  
And that’s where the speech goes off the rails since the cop runs from the crime, runs from the truth   
  
  
With your hobbies you’ll never amount to much   
I hope so   
  
^There’s some rhetoric  
  
The main character can’t exist in society given his inarguable manner   
  
  
The main character is convinced to solve a murder by the convincing coach owner   
  
He quotes his ethos, who are you to solve the case...  
“My name is blah blah and I am probably the greatest detective in the world”  
  
The guy who is black is singled out for such   
  
Main character jumps to conclusions and in the rhetoric of the movie he keeps everyone calm by being in charge of the case, unilaterally he soothes, its unrealistic   
  
He has a line that goes...  
When you   
When you   
When you,  
Which figure is that in word hero or tyfa?  
  
Slow music that adds to a pathetic ending  
The beginning had some exciting music but the murder scene has a chilling piano key music overture
