### Key Speakers
- Glenn Beck

### Notes
I can’t disprove they left it out, therefore they must have left it out...
- Fallacy of ignorance

Glenn speaks to David...
What are David’s credentials?
What does he know about this topic?
Who did he get his facts from?
Who is David?


“He May have won the American Revolutionary War! How did he win the war? I’m going to let David tell the story in a minute”... a hasty conclusion

Two guests...
One from Washington and lee university in Virginia...what is that school's student body?
