## Notes
- Opening Chairman has a list of questions
  - Appears to be republican by rhetoric 
  - Nadler appears democratic based on rhetoric
    - makes a logos appeal
      - 6,121 hate crimes against 7,615
- Every one of the congressmen and women is well-lit and mic'ed well
- Chairman begins questioning
- These senators are all repetitve and calmly when they're asking a question, for example:
  - Chairman: Peter Struck, special agent at FBI changes the words from 'grossly negligent'  to 'extremely careless' in former director comey's statement closing the clinton investigation. Are you aware of that?
  - Wray: I've heard some of th esame information you have. 
  - Chairman: Do you know by chance what the criminal intent standard is under the espionage act? In particular (he lists the specific part of the code.)
  - Wray: I haven't studied the statue recently but I believe it's gross negligence.
  - Chairman: That's right it is gross negligence. Would it be accurate to say that a senior FBI official changed the wording of the statement to ensure that secretary clinton was not liable under the espionage act?
  - Wray: Well, mr. chairman, as you may know the handling of the investigation into secretary clinton is currently the subject of an outside independent investigation by the inspector general and i think it would not be appropriate of me to speculate what the inspector general will or will not find.
  - Chairman: that is...probably appropriate...but it is not at all inappropriate to ask you to draw a legal conclusion about a standard in the law that was changed in a statement that your predecessor put out as a justification for closing the investigation of the former secretary of state
  - Wray: as i said mr. chairman, i believe the standard is gross negligence. I leave it to others to conclude whether 'extremely careless' and 'gross negligence' are the same thing. But i will say that the particulars of the investigation and the decisions that were made and whether or not it was handled appropriately is, as i think it should be, the subject of an outside investigation by the inspector general and i look forward to his findings as i'm sure the committee does as well.
  - In the above example, we see wray give the same polished answer twice. it looks like:
