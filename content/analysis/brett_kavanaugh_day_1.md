### Notes
- Klobuchar is spitting [inarguables](), 'a good judge...'
  - then she goes on with a [catalog]()
- Sasse
  - making a point and says 'i don't really believe that,' which wrecks his [ethos]()
- Senator Coons
- Senator Blumenthal, Democrat
  - blumenthal cites rules, grassley asks blumenthal to quote language that contradicts his assertion that the rules blumenthal brings up do not apply, he is using his authority as well as a fallacy
- kavanaugh is expressionless the entire time
- kennedy
  - speaks in the first person frequently
- hirono uses a [catalog]() of new judges who did things she doesn't like
  - then uses 'it could take just one vote...' as a [repeater]()
- Crapo lists a lot of numbers, opening himself to many [unit fallacies]()
- Leahy 
  "its not only shameful its a sham" (what figure of speech is this?)
- Cornyn
  - cites a previous book that Kavanaugh wrote, a nod to his [ethos]()
- Durbin
  - throws off his glasses to make a visual point, whatever the opposite of [dubitatio]() is called, this is it
- Whitehouse
  - uses a [catalog]() for 5-4 decisions by supreme court justices
- Cruz
- Klobuchar
  - gesticulates everytime she makes an important point, what did aristotle say about this?
