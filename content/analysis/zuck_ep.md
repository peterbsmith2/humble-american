### Key Speakers

### Notes
demonstrative values in the beginning of eu parliament

specific examples of facebook's benefits
18 million european small businesses, mostly for free


but its also clear we haven't done enough to use these tools to prevent harm...

what we're doing

eddy haskelling... it will make experience worse, we agree with regulators and privacy advocates

the first question is a long speech that ends in facebook being a monopoly with too much power that needs to be broken up


another politician slamming zuckerburg on will you be remember with steve jobs and bill gates or a genius who has created a monster that destroys democracies

another politician blaming a bullying event on facebook, the death of a 17 yr old boy
