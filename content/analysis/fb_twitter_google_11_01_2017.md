### Russia
- Russia is the boogeyman enemy but the real enemy is within. Nobody likes the US government.
- The US electorate vote accordingly, they voted for a monster who didn't wear a mask like the monsters
- who have been elected into the Senate and the House. And, of course, none of them matter on the Internet.
- Not unlike the history of America, the people in the government front as powerful, but the real power lay
- in the hands of the voters and masses.
