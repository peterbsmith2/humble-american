With surprising speed, Garvey moves a step and a half across the living room and lands a punch hard against Frazier's face.  
  
The suspect looks up, stunned.  
  
"What was that for?" he asks Garvey.  
  
For a second or two, Garvey lets himself think about the question. The official answer, the one required for the reports, is that this detective was required to subdue a homicide suspect who attempted to resist arrest. The righteous answer, the one that is soon lost to any detective with time on the street, is that the suspect was struck because he is a cold-blooded piece of shit, a murderous bastard who in a single evening took the lives of an old man and a mother of two. But Garvey's own answer falls somewhere in between.
