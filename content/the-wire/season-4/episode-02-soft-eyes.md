**Herc**
By accident. It was accidental.

**Major Valchek**
And the mayor doesn't say anything?

**Herc**
I think he's pretty mad.
I mean, Major, l only took this detail
to try and make sergeant on this list.

**Major Valchek**
Kid, you made sergeant already.
Shit, if Royce gets re-elected,
you'll be a lieutenant in two years
and a major in four.
You go back down to the hall.
You act like it never happened.
You shut up. Say nothing to no one.

**Herc**
But the mayor, he's gonna...

**Major Valchek**
He's gonna watch and see how you carry it.
And, kid, you're a fucking rock.
When the mayor looks in your face,
he knows he can trust you with this.
And I'll bet in a couple of weeks,
he comes asking, real friendly-like,
what are you looking
to do with the department? With your career?
He's interested in you.
But he doesn't mention no blowjob,
and neither do you.
lt just lays there like a bad pierogi
on the plate,
both of you pretending it ain't there.

**Herc**
What if he screws me over?
Bounces me to a midnight shift?

**Major Valchek**
He does that, you will talk.
What I wouldn't give
to be in your shoes right now.
Kid, careers have been launched
on a hell of a lot less.
Just shut up and play dumb.

**Herc**
I can do that. No problem.
Thanks, Major.
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me on this.
I mean, it's a weight off my mind
talking to you.
It really is.

**Major Valchek**
Don't mention it.
Maybe you get a chance
to do me a turn one day
after you make rank, huh?

### Analysis
Valkchek encourages Herc to think about [character](). By showing good character, as in, character that benefits the mayor, Herc might get a promotion. However, Valkchek betrays any good character himself by stating if the Mayor is punitive, Herc ought to as well. To which the audience asks, 'how does _that_ accomplish anything?'
