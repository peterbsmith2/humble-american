# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Cost"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**McNulty**  
No way.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
Why not?  
  
**McNulty**  
Because a player wouldn't be  
the name on the liquor license.  
He'd have a connect for Barksdale's coke.  
He wouldn't walk into state troopers.  
  
**Greggs**  
He got a charge and now  
he's talking out his ass.  
  
**McNulty**  
Face it. You're never gonna get Avon  
or Stringer in the same room as the dope.  
We make this case on their voices alone.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
So maybe he can't buy from Barksdale.  
Maybe he can only buy  
from Savino or Wee-Bey.  
  
**Greggs**  
Fuck him, then.  
We already got Wee-Bey tied to a murder,  
and Savino's the runt of the litter.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**  
We can take what Orlando  
gives us about the club.  
The money laundering, maybe, or the girls.  
For that kind of cooperation,  
I'll drop a few years and call it fair.
