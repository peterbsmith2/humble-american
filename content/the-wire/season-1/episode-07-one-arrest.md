# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "One Arrest"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**Avon Barksdale**  
Who's snitching?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Nobody.  
  
**Wee-Bey**  
Is you sure on that, man?  
You done had the stick-up,  
then the jump-out.  
Now, they running up on Stink.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
My crew, we tight.  
All right?  
Ain't nobody holding no extra money.  
I checked all that.  
Maybe your ass just ran a stop  
or had a taillight out or some shit like--  
  
**Stink'num**  
You think I'd run a stop with $40,000?  
Fuck no.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Nigger, I don't know.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
Something is up.  
So go down there today...  
tell them hoppers you got  
working for you down there...  
that this shit is about to change.  
Stringer gonna come down there,  
he gonna run through the changes.  
Until this shit is straight, the Pit is dead.  

### Analysis  
D'Angelo is on defense and not using any of the tools at his disposal: 
- Spot fallacies: [Bad proof](), [Bad Conclusion](), [Disconnect between proof and conclusion]().
- [Audience Targeting]()  
  
By suggesting Stink ran a stop or had a tail-light out he was using the active voice and that is likely to direct anger back at him, not something beneficial when on defense. A better move would have been to use the [passive voice]().  
  
He also didn't flip back to offense, he just went and left. If he had his wits about him he could have [made the topic about a broader issue](find this in the book), as the rest of the gang does as the scene progresses.
