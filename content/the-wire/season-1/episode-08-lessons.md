# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "Lessons"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**Lt. Daniels**  
Burrell thinks I crossed him.  
  
**Marla Daniels**  
He said this to you?  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
In so many words.  
  
**Marla Daniels**  
You need to explain then--  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Explain what?  
That I'm bringing in a case  
that goes everywhere?  
Today, it was some senator's driver.  
Two days from now,  
a city councilman, maybe.  
He asked for a charge on Barksdale.  
That's all he asked for.  
  
**Marla Daniels**  
This thing with the legislative aide,  
who could've foreseen it?  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
He saw it. Burrell.  
See, this is the thing  
that everyone knows and no one says.  
You follow the drugs, you get a drug case.  
You start following the money,  
you don't know where you're going.  
That's why they don't want wiretaps or  
wired Cls or anything they can't control.  
Because once that tape starts rolling,  
who the hell knows what's going to be said?  
That son of a bitch McNulty asked me  
what the Deputy had on me.  
He actually asked me that.  
  
**Marla Daniels**  
What did you say?
