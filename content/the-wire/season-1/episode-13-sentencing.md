# The Rhetoric of The Wire “Sentencing”
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Intro
One of the important strategies of argument is based on [stance theory](). And in The Wire, David Simon, a rhetorician par excellence, writes Maurice Levy as a defense lawyer for drug kingpins who knows exactly the stance to take when he is defending his client in a sentencing meeting with the prosecution. 

**Maurice Levy**    
You all know that Baltimore city jurors  
are capable of just about anything.  
Now, look, if you want to sit  
around for months on end...  
going through a bunch of half-heard...  
half-said telephone conversations  
and see how well you do...  
I'll certainly respect the effort.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
It's not just talk on the wire.  
We've got seized money  
and lot of dope on the table.  
  
**Eileen Nathan**  
And a lot of violence.  
  
**Maurice Levy**    
All of which stops  
way short of Mr. Barksdale.  
You know this.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**    
All of it except for the New Jersey bust.  
That one he eats.   
  
**Maurice Levy**    
Maybe he does.  
Maybe he pleads to one count  
of attempted possession...  
and takes, I don't know, maybe three, four.  
Maybe he can arrange  
for everyone you have...  
on those tapes to follow suit.  
You get five-year pleas from those  
with no prior felony convictions...  
10 years for those with one prior,  
15 for two or more.  
  
**Eileen Nathan**  
What about the murders?    
    
**Maurice Levy**    
Maybe we acknowledge  
you've got Mr. Brice cold for the  
murder of Orlando Blocker  
and wounding of the police officer.    
    
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
Who?  
    
**Lt. Daniels**    
Wee-Bey.  
    
**Wee-Bey's lawyer**    
Representing Mr. Brice...  
I'm fairly confident that  
to avoid the death penalty...  
he'll proffer to at least a half dozen  
of your open murders.  
    
**Eileen Nathan**
Naming co-conspirators?  
For that kind of cooperation,  
I'd be willing to consider straight life.  
    
**Maurice Levy**    
No, indeed.  
I believe Mr. Brice is ready  
to take sole responsibility...  
for all of his crimes.  
Still, you walk away  
with at least a half-dozen clearances.  
  
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
Assets.    
    
**Maurice Levy**    
You take the strip club,  
you take whatever trucks and cars...  
you can link to the drug trafficking,  
and also whatever cash you've seized.    
    
**Lt. Daniels**    
He's got dozens of other properties:  
the funeral parlor, the towing company.    
    
**Maurice Levy**    
No. You get the cars,  
because you can tie them to illegal activity.  
But there's nothing else in his name to take.    
    
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
So, you keep most of the money,  
most of the real estate...  
and Stringer Bell stays on the street  
with his hand on the throttle.    
    
**Maurice Levy**    
If you have a charge against Mr. Bell, file it.  
Otherwise, I understand that nothing  
in all those hours of tape implicates him.    
    
**Rhonda Pearlman**    
Three or four years ain't enough, Maury. Not for Avon Barksdale.    
    
**Maurice Levvy**    
No? Make an offer.    
    
### Analysis  
Maurice makes an [introduction](), which starts with a [commonplace]() statement. The commonplace he chooses is "You all know that Baltimore city jurors are capable of just about anything." What makes this a commononplace is that it is not, strictly speaking a fact, that jurors are capable of anything in Baltimore. However, among his audience - other lawyers and a police lieutenant - who have seen unpredictable outcomes in the Baltimore courts, it is a shared opinion and that is as good as a fact, rhetorically. That shared opinion constitutes a commonplace.  Then Maurice narrates a vision for the future that is favorable to him and unfavorable to his audience.  
  
Rhonda, the prosectutor takes her stance and starts with the facts. Eileen, Rhonda's team member, continues with that statement of fact. Maurice counters, also on the facts. Liuentenant Daniels counters, also on the facts. Facts form the strongest rhetorical [stance](). In this room of characters we see rhetoric so well played in a way that only a screenwriter can provide.  
  
Now the next part is where Maurice is executing his prepared plan, which was constructed in a previous scene. He and Mr. Barksdale, drug kingpin, agreed that in order for Mr. Barksdale to get the best deal possible, they would need to deliver the people below him to the prosecution in a structured plea agreement. That is scapegoating and not a good tactic. What Maurice is doing is setting the terms. If an [ethos raising apology]() is what a person does in their own defense of a screwup, this is an ethos raising plea agreement.  
    
The conversation moves forward to Mr. Brice naming co-conspirators. The facts known to the audience of the show are that Mr. Brice had many thugs that he murdered innocent people with, among those "co-conspirators," is Mr. Barksdale. Here Team Barksdale is staying a strong rhetorically arguing unit. As well, Maurice uses the [advantageous](), speaking to what is good for his audience, when he says "Still, you walk away with at least a half-dozen clearances."  

The scene ends. And it ends well for Mr. Barksdale. And it ends with Maurice Levy, who set up the initial plea offer, asking the prosecution to make him a counter.    
    
Along the way, Maurice Levy defended his client using dictates of his situation. He relied purely on facts, the strongest stance possible. He used the advantageous to make the outcome look good to his audience. As this argument occurs, it is easy to see that the prosecution has no love for Maurice Levy, to say the least. If you see yourself as someone who comes from a good place of humanity, the natural tendency in an argument is to want your opponent to walk away happy. You want the argument to be a win-win, to be a step toward a future that everyone can enjoy, for all to be glad they had the opportunity to argue. But if thats not possible, you want to be on the good side of a win-lose.  
  
No one ever has the identical view of the future, therefore, as you deliberate and create it, you'll need [consensus]().  
  
And that's all he wrote.
