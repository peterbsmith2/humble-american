# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "The Detail"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
So, give me Sydnor.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
No way.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Give me Sydnor and I'll keep Prez.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
He's my best man, you can't take him.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I'm taking your worst, remember?  

**Lt. Contrell**  
How about Steinman?  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I'm working drugs in West Baltimore,  
I need a black guy for surveillance.  
I need Sydnor.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Jesus, know what Prez did this morning?  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
Tell me.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
He put a bullet through a wall,  
dry-firing in the detail office.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
Look, no promises.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
You give me Sydnor,  
I'll carry Pryzbylewski as long as I can.  
  
**Lt. Contrell**  
Fine, Cedric, fuck, whatever. Jesus Christ.  

### Analysis
In this vignette Lt Daniels is persistent in his argument that Contrell give him Sydnor. He asks four times in as many sentences. As written, Daniels is persistent without commiting any [rhetorical fouls]() nor resorting to [argument by stick](). In the show the tone of the actor is exasperated. However, in plain written letter above you can read that Lt. Daniels was 100% effective in his persuasiveness.

### Scene
**Foerester**  
How did you handle the judge?  
  
**Burrell**  
I told him we were looking  
closely at the situation.  
I asked him not to say anything publicly.  
  
**Foerester**  
So, then he's not gonna go public, right?  
  
Judge Phelan called this morning...  
crying about a witness  
in his murder trial who was killed.  
  
**Lt Daniels**  
Did the judge say where he heard it?  
  
**Foerester**  
He heard it from our man, McNulty.  
That's his pipeline on this crap.  
  
**Rawls**  
Pardon my French, but I got no problem  
giving that asshole up at this point.  
I don't need people I can't trust.  
  
**Burrell**  
Well, who does?  
  
**Rawls**  
The newspapers get hold of this,  
it'll be a complete clusterfuck.  
  
**Burrell**  
Okay, so the thing to do  
is reassure the judge...  
keep him off his damn soapbox.  
An arrest or two would help.  
  
**Lt Daniels**  
What if it's true?  
What if Barksdale ordered the murder  
of a state's witness?  

**Forester**  
Are you serious?  
  
**Rawls**  
Why would anyone do that  
after the witness testifies?  
It has no effect on the case.  
  
**Lt Daniels**  
Payback, plain and simple.  
  
**Rawls**  
Bullshit, plain and simple.  
  
**Lt Daniels**  
Look, I know there could be  
two dozen other reasons...  
for this man to be murdered, but what if--  
  
**Burrell**  
No money for pretrial.  
No witness protection program.  
Look, this is a poor fucking city, gentlemen.  
The last thing we ever need to do  
is to announce we lost a witness.  
I mean, it's hard enough  
pushing felony casework...  
through that courthouse as it is.  
  
**Rawls**  
You got to pull McNulty off this.  
  
**Lt Daniels**  
Who caught the murder case?  
  
**Rawls**  
Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner.  
  
**Lt Daniels**  
Then you'd have to pull him, too.  
  
**Burrell**  
No, we pull McNulty up,  
the judge will bring the press into this.  
I can see that a mile away.  
No, we're gonna sit tight,  
let McNulty take his best shot...  
and hope like hell he comes up short.  
  
### Analysis
In this vignette Burrell shines. He uses his ethos to make the final call on the way to handle the situation. His ethos comes from his rank, and that is the most persuasive form of argument according to aristotle.

### Scene
**D'Angelo**  
They used your name, Stringer, Wee-Bey...  
Savino, Peanut....  
They knew a lot of names. They knew a lot.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
But you didn't say nothing?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Shit, man, I don't know nothing.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
What was you writing then?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yo, they was talking about  
the man who got killed...  
and his kids, they asked me to write.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
What you got to do with them, Dee?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yeah, that's what I said.  
Then they cried  
about how the kids ain't doing so good.  
I'm like, it ain't gonna hurt for me  
to say I'm sorry the man got killed.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
Why the fuck you gotta say you're sorry?  
Motherfuckers tried to  
put your ass in the stir.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yeah, but it didn't turn out that way.  
You know, that's what I'm saying,  
it's a shame that y'all....  
I'm saying, it's a shame  
what happened to that man, all right?  
'Cause he didn't do anything  
but come off the elevator...  
when I was doing that thing  
that I was doing.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
What you think, cuz?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
About what?  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
I'm saying, what you think  
about what happened to the man?  
You think we killed the motherfucker?  
Speak your mind.  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Man, I don't know.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
Exactly.  
You don't know,  
and you don't need to know.  
And if we did, we had a reason.  
And if we didn't, we had a reason.  
But either way,  
you ain't got shit to do with it.  
It ain't on you, cuz.  
You feel me? It ain't on you.  
Now, if you get jacked again...  
I don't want to hear shit about  
you writing nothing to no one.  
Got it?  
  
**D'Angelo**  
Yeah.  
  
**Avon Barksdale**  
Come on, let's have some good times...  
and get some ribs  
before they done ate all the ribs up.  

### Analysis
Here, rhetorically, Avon Barksdale is winning. D'Angelo apologizes in a professional setting. That act of self-debasement is a tell and now Avon makes it clear to D'Angelo who he apologized to: men who were trying to put him in prison.  
  
The obvious improvement D'Angelo could have made here might be an [ethos-raising apology](), however, more than that he could have done something akin to [witness bragging](), which is simply to get his lawyer to represent him.  
The lawyers value is not that he knows more about the law, it is that he is a disinterested party to raise the ethos of his client.

### Scene
**Herc**  
This case isn't shit, Carv.  
  
**Carver**  
I know it.  
  
**Herc**  
We're dancing around  
with this motherfucker, typing shit out...  
taking pictures of assholes in hats.  
What the fuck is that?  
  
**Carver**  
It's bullshit.  
  
**Herc**  
I say we go down there right now.  
Right fucking now.  
We go into those towers,  
and we let them know.  
  
**Prez**  
[chuckles]  
  
**Herc**  
I'm serious.  
  
You got to let these motherfuckers know  
who you are.  
  
**Herc**  
You coming?  
  
**Prez**  
I'm with you.  
  
**Herc**  
Carv?  
  
**Carver**  
What the hell?  
  
**Herc**  
Let's do it.  
Come on.  
  
**[The Towers]**  
Shut it down. Five-O.  
Five-O, five-O, break out.  
  
**Carver**  
Yo, come here, man.  
Come here, where you going?  
Don't act like you don't know me.  
Get your hands up.  
  
**Herc**  
Put that down.  
  
**Prez**  
Drop that shit! Kiss the fucking ground!  
  
**Carver**  
Put your hands up.  
Don't look at me like I ain't talking English.  
  
**Herc**  
You got a needle on you?  
  
**Carver**  
Got anything in here that's gonna stick me?  
No? What's that?  
What you got in your pockets?  
You know what?  
Put your pants down, man.  
Put your pants down  
and get down on the ground.  
Get down on the fucking ground!  
All right, spread your shit out.  
Nice shoes. Think a happy thought.  
  
**[The Towers]**  
Why don't you go somewhere else  
with that bullshit?  
No-good motherfuckers.  
  
**Carver**  
Stay down, man, stay down.  
  
**Herc**  
Y'all can let Barksdale and them know  
who owns these towers.  
  
**Carver**  
'Cause we're coming back.  
  
**Herc**  
I'm sick of this shit.  
  
**[The Towers]**  
Kiss my ass!  
  
**Carver**  
We roll out, come back in an hour,  
catch everybody dirty.  
You'll see how that goes.  
  
**[Tower Resident]**  
That's bullshit, man.  
  
**Carver**  
Yo, stay down, man.  
  
**[Tower Resident]**  
That's fucked up. Man ain't did nothing.  
  
**Carver**  
Want something?  
  
**Prez**  
Move, shitbird.  
  
**Kid**  
I ain't doing nothing.  
  
**Prez**  
Really? I got nothing for you.  
  
**Kid**  
My eye, my eye.  
  
**Prez**  
Who you gonna eyefuck now?  
Are you serious?  
You bleed on my car?  
Don't bleed on my car.  
Get your shit off my car.  
  
**Carver**  
What the fuck's the matter with you?  
  
**Carver**  
Got a visual?  
  
**Herc**  
Fuck.  
  
**Herc**  
Get the radio.  
  
**Carver**  
11 :35, Signal 13.  
771 Franklin, in the Court.  
  
**Herc**  
Son of a bitch!  
  
**Carver**  
Shots fired, shots fired.  
Officers need assistance.  
  
**Herc**  
I'm hit!  
  
**Carver**  
Signal 13.  
Officer down, Officer down!  
  
**Herc**  
Shit!  
  
### Analysis
The rhetoric of this scene is subtle. As you read it, it doesn't have any fantastic devices. It's a few cops, Herc, Carver, and Prez shouting commands. There's no reply to the commands. When watching the scene it doesn't stand out, you're watching the picture. Yet, they're shouting commands at tenants of a high rise housing project complex. At the end of the scene those tenants start throwing stuff at the cops and one fires a gun. They're not arguing. The cops don't argue. It's all [argument by stick](), a rhetorical foul.

### Scene  
**Carver**    
They jumped us, Boss.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Who?  
  
**Carver**  
Fucking project niggers.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
What are you doing here  
at 2:00 in the morning?  
  
**Carver**  
Field interviews, sir, police work.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Police work?  
  
**Herc**  
Yeah.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I got a 14-year-old in critical  
but stable condition at University...  
and two witnesses who say  
one of you princes...  
cold-cocked him  
with the butt-end of a pistol.  
  
**Herc**  
No, sir.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I got his mother over at IID...  
filing a formal brutality charge...  
which for Herc will make an even four  
in the last two years.  
  
**Herc**  
None sustained.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
But all of them true.  
  
**Carver**  
Lieutenant We thought that--  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I got one less Crown Vic  
than I had last night.  
I'm out two Kevlar vests  
that burned in the car...  
two hand-held radios, a shotgun...  
and I'm about to lose this idiot here  
for a week or two of medical.  
And for what?  
  
**Carver**  
Lieutenant We thought that--  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
What did you all learn  
when you went to the Terrace...  
at 2:00 in the morning  
to conduct field interviews?  
What valuable information did  
we acquire from this situation?  
IID is gonna be on all three of you  
by afternoon...  
and if you don't get a story straight  
by then...  
you're gonna have a file thick enough  
to see the light of a trial board.  
Now tell me, who cold-cocked the kid?  
  
**Prez**  
Me.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Why?  
  
**Prez**  
He pissed me off.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
No, Officer Pryzbylewski,  
he did not piss you off.  
He made you fear for your safety  
and that of your fellow officers.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I'm guessing now, but maybe...  
he was seen to pick up a bottle  
and menace officers Hauk and Carver...  
both of whom had already sustained injury  
from flying projectiles.  
Rather than use deadly force  
in such a situation...  
maybe you elected to approach the youth,  
ordering him to drop the bottle.  
Maybe when he raised the bottle  
in a threatening manner...  
you used a Kel-Light,  
not the handle of your service weapon...  
to incapacitate the suspect.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Go practice.  
You fuck the bullshit up  
when you talk to internal...  
I can't fix it, you're on your own.  
  
### Analysis
Lt. Daniels has great rhetorical use of [division]() when suggesting a better story (bullshit) of what happened when Prez hit the kid with the butt of his gun.  Before that he does a lot of [narration](). Then he ends it with a [proof](), "go practice. You fuck the bullshit up when you talk to internal...I can't fix it, you're on your own." Perhaps, as is the case with non-dramatic real-life, there is no need for a formal conclusion, the scene simply ends.
