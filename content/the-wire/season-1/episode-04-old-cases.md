# The Rhetoric of The Wire: "Old Cases"
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire
### Scene
**Herc**  
Long fucking drive.  
Me and you drawing another shit detail.  
  
**Carver**  
This ain't a shit detail.  
  
**Herc**  
No?  
I'm in Upper fucking Marlboro, Maryland,  
and still going south.  
Look. Another cow.  
  
**Carver**  
Use your imagination.  
This little shitbird, having already been  
whipped good by us once...  
he sees us, right?  
And he starts crying like a little bitch...  
because he knows we drove  
all the way to Prince George's...  
for more of his ass, right?  
Imagine we jack him up,  
toss him into a small room...  
and tell him that Detective Mahone  
is near dead from the sucker punch.  
No shit. The drunk old fuck  
suddenly slipped into a coma.  
And now the Commissioner and  
Mrs. Mahone are at his bedside in the ICU.  
And we've been ordered to come down here,  
rip off his scrotum, put it in a jar...  
and drive it back to Baltimore, so it can sit  
with the fucking bowling trophies...  
behind the bar at the FOP Lodge.  
  
**Herc**  
hahaha  
  
**Carver**  
All right? After which...  
fucknuts stops whimpering long enough...  
to just start giving people up, whoever.  
Stringer Bell. Avon Barksdale.  
  
**Herc**  
Yeah?  
  
**Carver**  
Yeah.  
Little prick turns on everybody...  
and we break the case wide open.  
  
**Herc**  
Cool.  
  
**Carver**  
Right?

### Scene  
**Bunk**  
So, from all them hand-to-hands,  
nobody flipped?  
  
**McNulty**  
No, that part of town,  
Barksdale carries more weight than we do.  
Just like all these fucking homicides.  
Witnesses lying, witnesses paid off,  
witnesses backing up on their story.  
  
**Bunk**  
Can you blame them?  
  
**McNulty**  
Not really.  
Every now and then, we visit the projects.  
They live there.  
  
### Analysis  
McNulty and Bunk lacked [decorum]().

### Scene
**Wallace**  
Damn, Bodie. Fucked that nigger up.  
They stomped his ass.  
How he ain't courtside  
for banking a knocko?  
Boy, how you get home so quick?  
Nigger, what you steal?  
  
**Bodie**  
Camry XLE.  
You all want a ride?  
It's right around the corner.  
Man, Boy's Village ain't shit.  
I'm just too bad for that off-brand  
little-boy bullshit, man.  
It can't hold me.  
  
**DeAngelo**  
_laughing_  
  
**Bodie**  
What you laughing at? What's so funny?  
If you was me,  
your ass would still be down there.  
  
**DeAngelo**  
You ever seen a city jail, nigger?  
You ever caught a body?  
I'm the one who just got home, remember?  
Eight months over on Eager Street  
with a body on me.  
  
**Bodie**  
Yeah, you got the one.  
  
**DeAngelo**  
Yeah, the one you know about.  
You little motherfuckers need to ask around.  
Yo, out near the county, right,  
on the high end of the Eastside?  
They got these apartments, out there, right?  
So there was this little shorty  
who used to stay out there.  
She was, like....  
I ain't seen a female that fine since.  
I gotta say, Shorty was right.  
  
**Wallace**  
You fucked her?  
  
**DeAngelo**  
No, man, it wasn't like that.  
This was a shorty  
my uncle was messing with.  
They was going on at it for a little while...  
till she find out that my uncle got another  
little shorty round the way.  
More right to say he got a few of them  
around the way...  
know what I'm saying?  
So, she goes off the hook,  
talking about calling the police...  
about shit she ain't supposed to know.  
  
**Poot**  
Oh, shit.  
  
**DeAngelo**  
Yeah, you know it.  
But see, I got some creep to me,  
and my uncle, he know that shit.  
So they roll me out past her crib.  
And they show me how she lives  
right on the ground floor, first level.  
I go creeping around the back,  
to the back window.  
I got the .45 on me, the big gun.  
I walk up to the window and I look in,  
and it's dark as shit...  
because it's 3:00 a.m.,  
and you can't see shit.  
  
**Wallace**  
What did you do?  
  
**DeAngelo**  
So I pulled out the piece...  
and I start tapping with the back of it  
on the window.  
And it was quiet, but it was loud enough  
so she can hear that shit.  
That's what she heard, yo.  
Sure enough, she comes out.  
She's naked and shit.  
I don't know why the fuck,  
but she has a robe...  
and as she slipping on her robe,  
she turns on the light...  
and when she does that,  
and it's light on the inside...  
she can't see shit on the outside.  
  
**Poot**  
Damn, she naked.  
  
**DeAngelo**  
She hears that shit on the window  
and she ain't got no choice...  
but to walk over there and see what it is.  
She steps up...  
looks out...  
see where it's coming from.  
  
**Bodie**  
What happened?  
  
**Wallace**  
He shot her.  
  
**Poot**  
Yo, Dee, if she was all that,  
why didn't you fuck her first?  
  
**Wallace**  
Nigger, you sick, just shut up.  
  
**Poot**  
What? I'm just saying....  
  
**Wallace**  
There is something seriously wrong.
