# The Rhetoric of The Wire “Cleaning Up”
## Thank You For Arguing + The Wire  
### Scene  
**McNulty**  
How is she?  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
In and out of the morphine drip.  
They got her stabilized is all I know.  
Go on in.  
  
**McNulty**  
No.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Unfreeze your ass off that wall, then.  
Either pay your respects,  
or get your head back into this case.  
  
**McNulty**  
Fuck this case.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
Fuck it?  
Now you're just gonna, what,  
call off your little crusade?  
  
**McNulty**  
Is that what you think it was? A crusade?  
Avon Barksdale was a way  
to show everyone how smart I was...  
and how fucked up  
the department is, that's all.  
Just put Jimmy McNulty  
up on your shoulders...  
march him around the room,  
break out the keg.  
It was never about  
Avon Barksdale, Lieutenant.  
It was all about me.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
You think I didn't know that?  
You think we all didn't know?  
Listen, this case is gonna move forward...  
with you or without you.  
  
**McNulty**  
This case got her shot.  
I put a battery up her ass...  
and got her thinking  
this case meant something.  
And you know what?  
Burrell, Rawls, and them, they were right.  
This case means exactly shit.  
  
**Lt. Daniels**  
I know it meant damn near nothing to me  
when you came in beating the drum.  
But now we got that woman  
in there, that good police...  
breathing through a fucking tube,  
because it meant something to her.  
And the shooters who dropped Kima?  
They're still in the wind.  
And whoever sent those motherfuckers  
into that alley...  
he needs to get got, too.  
So you can stand there,  
dripping with liquor-smell and self-pity...  
if you got a mind to, but this case...  
it means something. Now.  

### Analysis
After feeling terrible at the shooting of  Greggs, for what is the first time, McNulty does not use the [advantageous](). In a way, he betrays his [ethos]() by stating that his [caring]() was all about him, not the pursuit of a drug dealer.
